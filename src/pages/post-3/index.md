After three weeks of developing this new site on my spare time. I am finally done!!!

Well... not "done." But, I am at a point where I feel comfortable publishing the site.

It has been a really fun experience to make my portfolio. Especially, since I made it from scratch, even the design which I found to be the most difficult part (shout to designers).

I used [Gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) to make this site which I did not have prior experience with. However, I do have experience with React so using Gatsby has been very fun.
