After three weeks of developing this new site on my spare time. I am finally done!!!

Well... not "done." But, I am at a point where I feel comfortable publishing the site.

It has been a really fun experience to make my portfolio. Especially, since I made it from scratch. I wanted to make sure I did not use any css frameworks.

In addition, I used [Gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/)** to make the site which I did not have prior experience with. However, I do have experience with React so using Gatsby has been very fun.

This is my first time running and publishing to a blog. I plan to keep it as an open format focused around code. I will be posting at least once per week.
